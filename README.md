# Challenge-1-code

This website started with very nondescriptive code. I went in and refactored the code to the best of my abilities. Some of the changes made include, renaming html elements to more up to date html, and organizing layout of code on html & css. Link to the deployed website will be included as well as screenshot of my final product as well.
